<h4>This project starts off with a log in page which checks with the persons database. It then takes the user to see the persons database that is which also has links to the other two databases (courses and rounds), a JSON showing golf courses nearby with their prices, and a page to upload files. At the bottom of each of these pages are links to see the necessary diagrams. Each of the displays for the databases is also a CRUD application which allows the user to do all standard things with a CRUD application with the Rounds database having a foreign key that links with the persons database. AJAX is used to display the different databases.</h4>
